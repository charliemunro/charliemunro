## ðŸŽ¯ Career Objectives

Iâ€™m a recent DCU graduate combining rigorous physics foundations with advanced dataâ€‘science and machineâ€‘learning expertise. I design and deliver endâ€‘toâ€‘end solutionsâ€”from data ingestion and preprocessing through predictive modelling to interactive dashboards and deployment.

**Target roles:**  
- **Data Analyst** â€“ Transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights  
- **Data Scientist** â€“ Developing and validating predictive models  
- **Machine Learning Engineer** â€“ Building and productionizing ML pipelines  
- **Quantitative Analyst** â€“ Applying statistical and computational methods in finance or tech
